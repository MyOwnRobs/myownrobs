**A Cursor-style AI Coding Agent for RStudio**

MyOwnHadley is a comprehensive AI-powered coding agent that seamlessly integrates as an RStudio extension, bringing state-of-the-art AI capabilities directly to R developers through an autonomous agent-based approach.

## 🚀 Features

- **🤖 Autonomous AI Agent**: True coding agent that automatically selects and executes appropriate tools based on natural language requests
- **💬 Integrated Chat Interface**: Familiar Shiny-based chat experience directly in RStudio
- **🔧 Comprehensive Toolkit**: Complete set of development tools including file operations, code execution, and project management
- **🎯 Context Awareness**: Automatically detects project structure, active files, and working directory
- **⚡ Multi-step Workflows**: Handles complex tasks like "Build a Shiny app that visualizes my dataset" through intelligent tool orchestration
- **🔍 Code Analysis**: Read, analyze, and understand existing code to provide contextual assistance
- **✏️ Intelligent Editing**: Refactor, optimize, and enhance code based on natural language instructions

## 📦 Installation

Install the development version of `{myownhadley}` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/MyOwnHadley/myownhadley) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MyOwnHadley/myownhadley")
```

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Launch the Agent**: After installation, you can launch the agent by calling `myownhadley::myownhadley()` in the R console, or by opening the MyOwnHadley addin through the RStudio Addins menu:
   - Go to `Addins` > `MyOwnHadley` in RStudio
   - Or use the command palette: `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` → "MyOwnHadley"

2. **Start Coding**: Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:
   - "Create a function to clean this dataset"
   - "Build a ggplot visualization of the iris dataset"
   - "Refactor this code to be more efficient"
   - "Add error handling to my function"

## 🔒 Data Privacy

Your data privacy is important to us. Here's a concise overview of MyOwnHadley's data practices:

* MyOwnHadley only stores per user their last active session, to maintain continuous functionality between chat sessions and RStudio/addin restarts.

* MyOwnHadley's API is developed using Next.js, and all services are hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

* The API's sole responsibility is to receive user's prompt, enhance it with R-developer-specific context, and securely forward it to the user's selected AI model provider. We do not store your prompts or the model responses on our servers beyond what is necessary for active session management.

**Our recommendation**: We recommend using MyOwnHadley with a project only if you are comfortable with the possibility of submitting its entire contents to your selected AI model provider, as the agent may access various files for comprehensive assistance.

**Model Provider Data Policies**

* [Gemini's data policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms).

We've strived to keep this section brief and clear. If you have any further questions or concerns about data privacy, please don't hesitate to [submit an issue on our GitHub tracker](https://github.com/MyOwnHadley/myownhadley/issues). We will thankfully address your inquiries and update this section as needed.
