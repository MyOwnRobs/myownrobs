**Include up to 5 keywords describing the tutorial content**

AI-assisted coding, R, package development, Shiny, Quarto

**Abstract (1200 characters max)**

_The summary should explicitly state the tutorial's learning objectives (https://teachtogether.tech/en/#s:process-objectives) and the relevance or usefulness of what is taught in the tutorial._

This hands-on tutorial will introduce R users to the transformative power of AI-assisted coding, specifically within the RStudio IDE. We will cover how to use AI-powered coding assistants to accelerate a variety of tasks, from generating boilerplate code and debugging scripts to building professional R packages.

Upon completion of this tutorial, participants will be able to:

* Grasp the benefits and limitations of using AI for code generation in R.

* Configure and use an AI-powered coding assistant within RStudio.

* Apply AI tools to write, debug, and refactor R functions and scripts efficiently.

* Leverage AI to automatically generate Quarto and R Markdown reports.

* Develop interactive Shiny applications with AI assistance.

* Streamline the process of turning R scripts into reusable R packages.

* Create a personal workflow that integrates AI for increased productivity.

Knowing how to take advantage of AI tools is becoming a core skill for data professionals and researchers. This tutorial provides a practical and focused introduction, enabling attendees to immediately apply these techniques to their daily work, saving time and reducing cognitive load on routine tasks.

**Who is the tutorial for?**

_Indicate whether it is aimed at people with specific disciplinary backgrounds or interests. Also, describe what participants should know beforehand to use this learning opportunity best. If you have defined a target audience (https://teachtogether.tech/en/#s:process-personas), include them here._

This tutorial is for anyone with a basic to intermediate understanding of R who is interested in improving their coding efficiency and knowledge. It is aimed at a wide audience, including data scientists, academic researchers, and students who use R for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

To get the most out of this learning opportunity, participants should have:

* Familiarity with the RStudio interface.

* A basic understanding of R syntax and data structures.

* Experience writing simple R functions and scripts.

Target Persona: Our primary persona is "Cruz, the Aspiring Researcher." Cruz is a graduate student who is proficient in R, but finds the coding process to be slow, repetitive, and manual. Cruz is motivated to learn new tools and techniques that can help write cleaner, more efficient code. This would allow Cruz to spend less time on coding logistics and more time on the core tasks of research, analysis, and publication.

**How long will the tutorial last?**

120 minutes

**Tutorial Structure**

_Please indicate how the time will be organized. Explain the moments or activities that involve practical work or interaction, as well as breaks, if any._

This is a hands-on tutorial with a focus on practical applications. The time will be organized as follows:

Part 1: Introduction to AI-Assisted Coding in R (15 minutes)

A focused overview of how AI can enhance R workflows, covering the spectrum from web-based chat interfaces to integrated RStudio assistants. Brief discussion of benefits and key limitations (accuracy, dependency, ethical considerations).

Part 2: Setup and Prompt Engineering Essentials (30 minutes - Hands-on)

Participants will configure their chosen AI assistant (with provided fallback options for those experiencing access issues).

Interactive exercise: Generate a simple R function using effective prompting techniques.

Mini-lesson: Best practices for writing clear, specific prompts for coding tasks.

Part 3: Core AI-Assisted Workflows (40 minutes - Hands-on)

Activity 1: Exploratory data analysis with AI assistance - from data loading to visualization.

Activity 2: Generating and customizing a Quarto report for the analyzed dataset.

Activity 3: Creating a basic interactive Shiny application.

**5-minute break**

Part 4: Advanced Applications (25 minutes - Hands-on)

Activity 1: Building reusable R functions with AI assistance.

Activity 2: Creating a basic R package structure from generated functions.

Part 5: Integration and Next Steps (10 minutes)

Quick showcase of the "AI Toolkit Starter Kit" - a curated selection of essential tools for continued learning.

Open discussion: sharing experiences and addressing specific use cases.

**What technical requirements must attendees meet in order to participate optimally?**

_(minimum R version, packages that need to be installed, if any minimum RAM or storage is required, etc.)_

**Software Requirements:**

* R version 4.1.0 or higher

* RStudio version 2023.06.0 or newer

**AI Service Access:**
